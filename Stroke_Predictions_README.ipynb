        "\n",
        "#### Understanding the patient, behavioral, and medical characteristics of patients that increase strokes:\n",
        "\n",
        "The medical stakeholder should know that older patients have more strokes, regardless of their gender; that mariage (even previous marriages), work type (especially self-employed, government employees, and private employees), and smoking status (especially former smokers) increases strokes; and that hypertension, heart disease, and average glucose level increase strokes.  The medical stakeholder should focus on those features (smoking status, hypertension, heart disease, and average glucose level) which can be changed for predicting and preventing strokes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Predicting future strokes based on the data provided:\n",
        "Overall, the LightGBM with SMOTE was the best model, compared to the Random Forest Classifier and the Logistic Regression model.  Feature engineering further improved the predictions.  However, the best model was not even very good at predicting the stroke class--it only achieved 19% precision and 11% recall for the stroke class. Plus, it had an 89% rate of false negatives--that means that 89% of people who will have a stroke were actually predicted to not have a stroke!\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations & Next Steps\n",
        "The information collected provided some insight into the patient characteristics that increase strokes, but did not predict strokes well.  The medical stakeholder should collect different data--there are clearly other medical features that were not captured in this data set that can predict future strokes better.\n",
